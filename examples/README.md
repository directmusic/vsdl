# VSDL Examples

## Window

This is the most basic SDL2 example. It only requires the base SDL2 library and initializes an empty window with a basic event loop.

## Audio

This is a simple SDL2 Audio example. It loads in a small `.wav` file which can be controlled using some basic keyboard events. Press Up or Down to controller volume and Left or Right to seek forward or backwards in the track. It will automatically loop.

## Controller

This is a basic demo of the GameController & Joystick functionality. This requires a game controller (e.g. XBox or Switch controller) to be plugged into the computer. The terminal will update to show the on-going input activity for the controller.

## GFX

This example shows off loading a simple `.bmp` and using the renderer to display a background behind it.

## GL

This is a basic demo of the linking OpenGL to the GFX Window to render 2D/3D. This requires the OpenGL library to be available on the system.

## Image

This demo showcases the SDL Image library by loading in a `.jpg` background and the V and SDL logos in a `.png` format. This requires the runtime libraries included with SDL Image to run.

## Messagebox

This showcases a very simple example of the Messagebox popups.

## System

This example makes a few basic calls to platform-agnostic functions to get details about the current system.

## TTF

This demo showcase the SDL TTF library by loading in two different `.ttf` files in different sizes and styles.
